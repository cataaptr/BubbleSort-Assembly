# 🧮 Bubble Sort

This is a project written in Assembly model X86 that sorts using the Bubble Sort algorithm, a string of negative and positive numbers, the numbers being stored on 16 bits.

# 📌 Steps
1. Prompts the user to enter a number of numbers
2. Reads the number of numbers and stores them in a vector
3. Sort the vector using the Bubblesort sorting algorithm
4. Show sorted numbers
